## Homework8 Week9

You can run Point_Simplifier.rmd with the input Ridge5_test.csv. The output should be the same as Points5.csv.
However, you will need the packages "deldir", "rgeos", "tidyverse", "graph", "sp", "PairViz", and "TSP". And you would need to change the input and output locations in the program to be from your computer or hoffman, not mine.

In the image, orange pixels are the input, blue is after deldir/rgeos analysis, and green is the ouput, after TSP/PairViz.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
You must submit a complete version of the program in this **repository**. 
It should take some input and give the desired output.
This is due before next discussion section.

**Important:** You must include some input, so Daniel can run your script.
